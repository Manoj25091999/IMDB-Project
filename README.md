# IMDB-Project using Bidirectional LSTM
While building this project our objective was to predict the sentiments of people (positive,1/negative,0) on different movies based on the given feature like Review and Sentiments. I have performed all the steps from data gathering to the model deployment. During Model (neural network) evaluation, I created and compared various combinations of deep learning layers on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one, what I found is that just adding simple layers in neural network was not giving me that much val_accuracy (around 75-80%) in comparison to bidirectional LSTM layer (val_accuracy around 85-86%). So in this module I have predicted whether the person's sentiments are positive or not on "IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset" using bidirectional LSTM neural network.
