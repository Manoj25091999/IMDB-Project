# Sentiment analysis using Bidirectional LSTM (Natural Language Processing)
While building this project our objective was to predict the sentiments of people (positive,1/negative,0) on different movies based on the given feature like Review and Sentiments. I have performed all the steps from data gathering to the model deployment. During Model evaluation I compared various ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines etc.) on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one, then I also created a neural network to check its performance against the ML models that I created, what I found is that ML models were not giving me that much val_accuracy (around 75-80%) in comparison to Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network (val_accuracy around 85-86%). So in this module I have predicted whether the people's sentiments are positive or not based on "IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset" using Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network.

Note: The project can be deployed in flask but there are some problems with its deployment in heroku, so currenlty this project is in deployment stage in heroku platform.
